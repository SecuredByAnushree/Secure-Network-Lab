# Secure Network Lab

## Description
This project involves configuring a virtual lab using VirtualBox to simulate secure networks. It demonstrates how to perform network security testing and vulnerability assessment.

## Tools Used
- **Nmap**: For network scanning and reconnaissance.  
- **Metasploit**: For penetration testing.  
- **Wireshark**: For analyzing network traffic and detecting vulnerabilities.  

## Key Outcomes
- Set up a secure virtual environment for testing network configurations.  
- Detected and documented vulnerabilities in sample systems.  
- Developed strategies for mitigating identified security risks.  

## How to Use
1. Install VirtualBox and create a virtual lab setup.  
2. Use the provided scripts and guidelines to simulate different network environments.  
3. Test for vulnerabilities using the tools listed.  

## Repository Contents
- `Lab_Setup_Guide.pdf`: Step-by-step instructions for setting up the virtual lab.  
- `Scripts/`: Automation scripts for testing and scanning.  
- `Reports/`: Sample reports of detected vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies.
